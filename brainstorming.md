Advantages of Combining Global and Unitary APIs
Global Configuration:

Ease of Use: Users can configure the SDRAM easily by setting all necessary parameters at once during initialization.
Efficiency: It ensures a simple and clean setup process, especially for applications where SDRAM settings do not need to change after the initial configuration.
Suitable for Most Applications: For many use cases, once the SDRAM is configured, it remains constant throughout the lifetime of the application.
Unitary Configuration:

Runtime Flexibility: Users can adjust specific parameters dynamically at runtime without resetting the entire configuration, making the SDRAM interface more adaptable.
Granular Control: This gives advanced users control over specific parameters (e.g., CAS latency, column bits, etc.) for optimization, based on the application's current requirements (like switching between low-power and high-performance modes).
Perfect for Dynamic Systems: For applications that work with external memories or need to change SDRAM configurations depending on different operating modes (e.g., high performance vs. low power), unitary APIs provide this critical capability.
Key Benefits for SDRAM and External Memory Management:
Best of Both Worlds:

By offering both global and unitary APIs, you cater to both novice users (who want simple initialization) and advanced users (who need to tweak specific parameters).
Novice users can stick with the global configuration, while more experienced developers can dive into unitary APIs to modify settings as needed.
Better Performance:

Having the ability to fine-tune SDRAM at runtime helps optimize the system for different use cases. For example, an application could adjust CAS latency to match the external memory characteristics, or switch memory configurations when working with different devices.
User Experience:

Offering this level of flexibility enhances the user experience by giving them the freedom to adapt SDRAM performance and behavior to their needs.
It also helps improve compatibility with external memories, as you can adjust timing and memory parameters to match the specific requirements of the external SDRAM or other memory components connected to the system.
Practical Example
Imagine a scenario where an embedded system switches between different modes of operation—such as deep sleep mode, active data processing mode, or external memory interface. With both global and unitary APIs:

Global Configuration: When the system boots up, the SDRAM can be initialized with default timing and memory parameters using a global configuration.

Unitary Configuration:

When switching to data processing mode, the application might need to optimize for speed, so the CAS latency could be increased or the data bus width expanded.
When switching to low-power mode, the timing parameters and memory width might need to be adjusted to reduce power consumption.
If working with an external memory like Flash or another SDRAM chip, users could modify the SDRAM interface timing to optimize communication with that specific memory device.
This flexibility ensures optimal performance, power management, and compatibility across different modes and external memories.

Conclusion
By providing both global and unitary APIs for SDRAM timing and memory configurations:

You make the SDRAM interface adaptable for a wide range of applications.
The system can be optimized dynamically, enhancing both performance and power efficiency.
You offer granular control for those who need it, while keeping things simple for those who prefer a global configuration.
This combination will undoubtedly improve the experience for users, especially those working with external memories in embedded systems, making their SDRAM management easier and more efficient.

Certainly! Let's walk through a real-world example where we implement both global and unitary configuration for managing the SDRAM peripheral in an STM32 microcontroller. We'll focus on how this approach can be applied effectively for timing and memory configuration.

Scenario:
An embedded system has two operating modes:

High-Performance Mode: Requires fast access to SDRAM with high throughput (wider data bus, higher CAS latency).
Low-Power Mode: Aims to reduce power consumption by using lower CAS latency and a narrower data bus.
We also need to interface with an external memory where timing parameters need to be optimized.

Global and Unitary API Setup
We will:

Initialize the SDRAM with a global configuration at startup.
Provide unitary setter functions to change timing and memory parameters dynamically during runtime.
Implement a function to switch between High-Performance and Low-Power modes dynamically.
Optimize SDRAM configuration when interfacing with an external memory device.
1. Global SDRAM Configuration
At system startup, we initialize the SDRAM with a default global configuration. This configuration includes the most commonly used settings that fit the High-Performance Mode.

SDRAM Global Configuration Example
c
Copier le code
#include "stm32f7xx_hal.h"

// Declare SDRAM handle and configuration structures
SDRAM_HandleTypeDef hsdram;
FMC_SDRAM_TimingTypeDef SDRAM_Timing;
FMC_SDRAM_InitTypeDef SDRAM_MemConfig;

void SDRAM_GlobalInit(void)
{
    // Initialize SDRAM Memory Config
    SDRAM_MemConfig.SDBank             = FMC_SDRAM_BANK1;
    SDRAM_MemConfig.ColumnBitsNumber    = FMC_SDRAM_COLUMN_BITS_NUM_8;   // 8 bits
    SDRAM_MemConfig.RowBitsNumber       = FMC_SDRAM_ROW_BITS_NUM_11;     // 11 bits
    SDRAM_MemConfig.MemoryDataWidth     = FMC_SDRAM_MEM_BUS_WIDTH_16;    // 16-bit bus
    SDRAM_MemConfig.InternalBankNumber  = FMC_SDRAM_INTERN_BANKS_NUM_4;  // 4 banks
    SDRAM_MemConfig.CASLatency          = FMC_SDRAM_CAS_LATENCY_3;       // Higher CAS latency for performance
    SDRAM_MemConfig.WriteProtection     = FMC_SDRAM_WRITE_PROTECTION_DISABLE;
    SDRAM_MemConfig.SDClockPeriod       = FMC_SDRAM_CLOCK_PERIOD_2;      // Default clock period
    SDRAM_MemConfig.ReadBurst           = FMC_SDRAM_RBURST_ENABLE;       // Enable read burst
    SDRAM_MemConfig.ReadPipeDelay       = FMC_SDRAM_RPIPE_DELAY_1;       // 1 cycle delay

    // Initialize SDRAM Timing Config
    SDRAM_Timing.LoadToActiveDelay    = 2;
    SDRAM_Timing.ExitSelfRefreshDelay = 7;
    SDRAM_Timing.SelfRefreshTime      = 4;
    SDRAM_Timing.RowCycleDelay        = 7;
    SDRAM_Timing.WriteRecoveryTime    = 3;
    SDRAM_Timing.RPDelay              = 2;
    SDRAM_Timing.RCDDelay             = 2;

    // Initialize SDRAM with global settings
    if (HAL_SDRAM_Init(&hsdram, &SDRAM_MemConfig, &SDRAM_Timing) != HAL_OK)
    {
        // Handle initialization error
        Error_Handler();
    }
}
This function configures the SDRAM to use a 16-bit data bus and a CAS latency of 3 for maximum throughput. This global configuration is applied at startup to set the SDRAM in High-Performance Mode.

2. Unitary API for Memory and Timing Configuration
We will now provide unitary setter functions for modifying specific SDRAM parameters (such as CAS latency, data bus width, and timing parameters) during runtime.

Unitary API for Memory Configuration
c
Copier le code
void SDRAM_SetCASLatency(uint32_t new_cas_latency)
{
    SDRAM_MemConfig.CASLatency = new_cas_latency;

    // Reinitialize SDRAM with updated CAS latency
    if (HAL_SDRAM_Init(&hsdram, &SDRAM_MemConfig, &SDRAM_Timing) != HAL_OK)
    {
        // Handle error
        Error_Handler();
    }
}

void SDRAM_SetDataWidth(uint32_t data_width)
{
    SDRAM_MemConfig.MemoryDataWidth = data_width;

    // Reinitialize SDRAM with updated data bus width
    if (HAL_SDRAM_Init(&hsdram, &SDRAM_MemConfig, &SDRAM_Timing) != HAL_OK)
    {
        // Handle error
        Error_Handler();
    }
}

void SDRAM_SetColumnBits(uint32_t column_bits)
{
    SDRAM_MemConfig.ColumnBitsNumber = column_bits;

    // Reinitialize SDRAM with updated column bits number
    if (HAL_SDRAM_Init(&hsdram, &SDRAM_MemConfig, &SDRAM_Timing) != HAL_OK)
    {
        // Handle error
        Error_Handler();
    }
}
These functions allow us to update specific parameters like CAS latency and data bus width without affecting other settings.

Unitary API for Timing Configuration
c
Copier le code
void SDRAM_SetRowCycleDelay(uint32_t delay)
{
    SDRAM_Timing.RowCycleDelay = delay;

    // Reinitialize SDRAM with updated timing
    if (HAL_SDRAM_Init(&hsdram, &SDRAM_MemConfig, &SDRAM_Timing) != HAL_OK)
    {
        // Handle error
        Error_Handler();
    }
}

void SDRAM_SetSelfRefreshTime(uint32_t time)
{
    SDRAM_Timing.SelfRefreshTime = time;

    // Reinitialize SDRAM with updated timing
    if (HAL_SDRAM_Init(&hsdram, &SDRAM_MemConfig, &SDRAM_Timing) != HAL_OK)
    {
        // Handle error
        Error_Handler();
    }
}
3. Switching Between High-Performance and Low-Power Modes
Now, we use these unitary functions to switch between different operating modes, dynamically adjusting SDRAM memory and timing parameters.

High-Performance Mode (Default Mode)
c
Copier le code
void SwitchToHighPerformanceMode(void)
{
    // Set CAS latency to 3 (higher latency, more performance)
    SDRAM_SetCASLatency(FMC_SDRAM_CAS_LATENCY_3);

    // Set the data bus width to 32 bits for maximum throughput
    SDRAM_SetDataWidth(FMC_SDRAM_MEM_BUS_WIDTH_32);

    // Adjust other timing settings for performance
    SDRAM_SetRowCycleDelay(7);  // Longer row cycle delay
    SDRAM_SetSelfRefreshTime(5);  // Self-refresh timing for high performance
}
Low-Power Mode (Optimized for Energy Efficiency)
c
Copier le code
void SwitchToLowPowerMode(void)
{
    // Set CAS latency to 2 (lower latency, less power consumption)
    SDRAM_SetCASLatency(FMC_SDRAM_CAS_LATENCY_2);

    // Set data bus width to 16 bits to save power
    SDRAM_SetDataWidth(FMC_SDRAM_MEM_BUS_WIDTH_16);

    // Adjust timing settings for low power
    SDRAM_SetRowCycleDelay(4);  // Shorter row cycle delay
    SDRAM_SetSelfRefreshTime(3);  // Reduced self-refresh time for power savings
}
In Low-Power Mode, we reduce the data bus width to 16 bits and lower the CAS latency to 2. We also adjust timing parameters to minimize power consumption.

4. Managing SDRAM Timing for External Memory Interface
In some cases, your system might need to interface with an external memory device (e.g., external Flash or another SDRAM chip). For this scenario, we may need to fine-tune the SDRAM timing to ensure compatibility.

Optimizing SDRAM for External Memory
c
Copier le code
void OptimizeForExternalMemory(void)
{
    // Adjust timing for external memory interface
    SDRAM_SetRowCycleDelay(9);  // Increase row cycle delay to match external memory timing
    SDRAM_SetSelfRefreshTime(6);  // Adjust self-refresh timing for external memory

    // Optionally change memory configuration if needed
    SDRAM_SetCASLatency(FMC_SDRAM_CAS_LATENCY_3);  // Higher CAS latency for external memory compatibility
}
This function adjusts the row cycle delay and self-refresh timing to optimize the SDRAM interface when communicating with an external memory device.

5. Applying the Approach in Practice
Now, let's tie everything together. Here’s a simplified workflow in the main application:

c
Copier le code
int main(void)
{
    // System Initialization
    HAL_Init();
    SystemClock_Config();

    // Initialize SDRAM globally (High-Performance Mode by default)
    SDRAM_GlobalInit();

    // Main Loop
    while (1)
    {
        // Example: Switch to Low-Power Mode based on some condition
        if (systemIsInLowPowerMode())
        {
            SwitchToLowPowerMode();
        }

        // Example: Switch back to High-Performance Mode
        if (systemNeedsHighPerformance())
        {
            SwitchToHighPerformanceMode();
        }
